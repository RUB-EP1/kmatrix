    "text": "Introduction\nThe K-Matrix formalism is a powerful tool for modeling scattering amplitudes in high energy particle physics, and thus can provide information about resonance properties and the subatomic processes in which they participate. The International K-Matrix Day can be seen as a conversation starter for everything related to the K-Matrix. The lectures and practical examples are designed to provide theoretical instruction for those who are new to the concept of amplitude analysis. It will also cover some advanced topics related to theoretical behaviour and applications to experimental data, as well as consistency in the implementation of the formalism. We also encourage the participants to start a discussion about their favorite topic related to the K-matrix, so that one can possibly work on a problem together. The goal of the K-Matrix Day is to share information about this powerful tool and make it available to anyone who wants to learn more.\n💬 For further discussions, we therefore refer to our Slack channel: Join here"
